You should (soon) be able to install from PyPI:

```
pip install trusd   # you might need to use pip3
```

You can also install it from source:

```
git clone git@github.com:mathiasbockwoldt/TruSD.git
# OR
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbockwoldt/TruSD.git

cd TruSD
pip install -e .   # you might need to use pip3
```

Either way, you should be able to run trusd from the command line afterwards:

```
trusd --help
```
